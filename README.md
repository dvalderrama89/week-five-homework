# Workday Scheduler - Week 5 Homework
The goal of the app was to combine jQuery, bootstrap and momentjs to create a scheduler that saves the user's data in local storage per day. Bootstrap was used to style the rows and columns as well as color the table elements. jQuery was used to create functions that are called when the document is ready and populate the table. Finally, momentjs was used to calculate the time elements such as the date in the header and also calculate what hour of the day it is in order to color the table rows appropriately.
